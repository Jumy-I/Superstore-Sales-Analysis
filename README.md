# Key Performance Metrics
**KPI	Value**
Total Sales	**$2,297,200.80**
Total Profit	**$286,397.02**
Orders Placed	**9,994**
Profit Margin	**12.47%**


# Monthly Sales & Profit Trend
The combo chart highlights fluctuations in monthly sales and profit over the 12-month period:
•	Peak Sales occurred in **November** and **December** with November surpassing **$350k**.
•	**March**, **September** and **December** were the most profitable months
•	**February**, **April** and **July** underperformed, with relatively lower profit despite moderate sales.
This seasonal pattern can inform marketing and inventory planning strategies.

# Category Breakdown
•**	Technology** dominated with over** $800k** in sales and highest profit of over ** $140k**, proving its strategic value
•	**Office supplies** had moderate sales, but maintained consistent profit margins than Furniture.
•	**Furniture**, despite high sales of over** $700k**, **yielded minimal profit of just $18k**, raising concerns about pricing or supplier costs.
The company should reassess its Furniture category cost structure or discount strategy. Technology expansion could potentially yield an additional $30-$40k in annual profit given its strong margin performance.

# Regional Performance
Sales were highest in the **West ($725k)** and **East ($678k)** regions.
However, profit distribution reveals critical gaps:
•**	West** and **East** generated strong profits, with West leading with the highest sales volume while East region showed balanced sales and profit performance.
•	**Central** and **South **region show significantly lower profit, especially Central region despite the fact that the total goods sold was higher than the South region, South generated more profits than the Central region. This suggests cost inefficiencies or weaker customer engagement.
Strategic attention should be given to underperforming regions – either through targeted promotions, pricing review, or operational improvements.

# Top 10 Product Sub-categories by Profit
The most profitable sub-categories include;
**•	Copiers (highest profit contributor)
•	Phones
•	Accessories**
Lowest performers (e.g. **Furnishings and Envelopes**) made it into the top 10 but had minimal profit, indicating possible over-discounting or operational costs eating into margins.
Refining the assortment and possibly delisting or renegotiating low-margin sub-categories could optimize profit.

# Business Insights & Recommendations
**Immediate Priority Actions**
1.	**Focus on Technology:** Boost promotions and inventory around high-performing products like copiers and phones – potential **$30k+ annual** profit increase.
2.	**Investigate Furniture Margins:** Audit cost structure, vendor terms and discounts to improve current margin.
3.	**Central Region Operational Review:** Study why south region achieves better profit
4.	**Improve Central and South Region sales:** Explore localized campaigns or partnerships.
5.	**Leverage Seasonal Trends**: Capitalize on **November- December** momentum with early marketing pushes.
6.	**Consider Product Rationalization:** Remove or revamp low-profits products.

# Next Steps
Future analysis can be expanded using:
•	Power BI for interactive web dashboards
•	SQL to analyze transaction-level data
•	Python for advanced customer segmentation and forecasting
